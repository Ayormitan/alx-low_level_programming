C Debugging Project
This project focuses on debugging C code to identify and fix issues. It also introduces the concept of "Rubber Duck Debugging" to help programmers solve problems. The tasks involve correcting code and ensuring it adheres to specified requirements.

General Requirements
Editors
You can use any of the following editors: vi, vim, emacs.

Compilation
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.

Newlines
Ensure that all your code files end with a newline.

Coding Style
Use the Betty style for your code, which will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.

Repository Structure
This repository contains the following elements:

0-main.c: A file created based on main.c to test the positive_or_negative() function for the case of 0.
1-main.c: A main file where a part of the code causing an infinite loop is commented out (not deleted).
2-largest_number.c: A file where the code is fixed to correctly print out the largest of three numbers, regardless of the case.
3-print_remaining_days.c: A program that converts a date to the day of the year and determines how many days are left in the year, considering leap years.
Task Descriptions
Task 1: Testing positive_or_negative() Function
Created 0-main.c to test the positive_or_negative() function with a case of 0.
Task 2: Fixing an Infinite Loop
In 1-main.c, commented out (not deleted) the problematic code that was causing an infinite loop.
Task 3: Correcting 2-largest_number.c
Fixed the code in 2-largest_number.c to correctly print the largest of three numbers, regardless of the case.
Task 4: Handling Dates and Leap Years
Developed a program in 3-print_remaining_days.c that converts a date to the day of the year and considers leap years when calculating the remaining days in the year.
Project Structure
The project's file structure is organized according to the tasks specified, with each task corresponding to a specific file. The repository includes a README.md file to provide an overview of the project.
