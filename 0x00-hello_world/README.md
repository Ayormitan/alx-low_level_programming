# C - Hello, World

This repository contains a collection of C programs and shell scripts that demonstrate various aspects of C programming and shell scripting. These scripts and programs are designed to meet specific requirements and follows betty coding standards. Below, you'll find information about the contents of this project and how to use them.

## General Requirements

- All C files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using GCC, with the following options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- All C files and scripts should end with a new line.
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation.
- The Betty coding style should be followed for C code.
- Shell scripts should be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Shell Scripts

### 1. Preprocessor Script (`script1.sh`)

This script runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file. The C file name should be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output is saved in the file 'c'.

### 2. Compile Without Linking Script (`script2.sh`)

This script compiles a C file but does not link it. The C file name should be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file is named the same as the C file but with the extension '.o'.

### 3. Assembly Code Generation Script (`script3.sh`)

This script generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file. The C file name should be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file is named the same as the C file but with the extension '.s'.

### 4. Compile to Executable Script (`script4.sh`)

This script compiles a C file and creates an executable named 'cisfun'. The C file name should be saved in the variable $CFILE.

### 5. Another Compile to Executable Script (`script5.sh`)

Similar to script4.sh, this script compiles a C file and creates an executable named 'cisfun'. The C file name should be saved in the variable $CFILE.

## C Programs

### 6. Grammar Art Program (`6-grammar_art.c`)

This C program prints "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, using the printf function. It returns 0 and compiles without warnings when using the -Wall gcc option.

### 7. Size of Types Program (`7-size.c`)

This C program prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. It produces the exact same output as in the example. Warnings are allowed, and it returns 0. You might need to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on your Linux to test the -m32 gcc option.

### 8. Assembly Code Generation Program (`8-main.c`)

This C program generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file. The C file name should be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file is named the same as the C file but with the extension '.s'.

### 9. Custom Printf Program (`9-main.c`)

This C program prints "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error. It does not use functions listed in the NAME section of the man (3) printf or man (3) puts. It returns 1 and compiles without any warnings when using the -Wall gcc option.

## Usage

The scripts can be used by doing ./scriptname

## Testing
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Limitations

The scripts are exactly two lines
